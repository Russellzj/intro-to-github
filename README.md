# intro-to-github
This is a demo repository to practice using GitHub.

It has two files in the *Code* tab:
- *README.md* is the description of this repo (you are currently reading it)
- *.gitignore* is a file that specifies which filse and directories must be ignored by Git

You cannot make changes in these files directly because you are not collaborator.

The *Issues* tab is used to discuss ideas, enchacements, bugs, questions, and so on. They are grouped by *Open* and *Closed*.

The *Pull requests* tab contains proposals to make some changes in the files located in the repository. Repo's owners may review a request and put your changes if they look good.

You can create an *Issue* or make a *Pull request* to contribute in the project.
